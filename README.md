# Ryper-Hecipes
My contribution to the Hyper Recipes assignment.

Application consists of two activities: one for displaying a list of recipes and the other for displaying details about each recipe.
The collection of recipes is fetched from the [backend endpoint](http://hyper-recipes.herokuapp.com/recipes) provided by Hyper Recipes.
